This project manages dependencies with Poetry (https://github.com/sdispater/poetry), so you can install with Poetry.

```{bash}
> poetry shell
> poetry install
```

You will need arXiv databases. You can download it at https://github.com/rosinality/arxiv-sanity/releases/tag/v1.0

Now you can run web server with server.py:

```{bash}
> python server.py
```

Web server will serves at localhost:8000.

You can update arXiv databases with fetcher.py

```{bash}
> python fetcher.py
```

I recommend you to schedule this scripts daily for make database up-to-date, by using tools like cron.
